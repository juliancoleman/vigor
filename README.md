# Vigor

To use this app, simply clone with `git`, and proceed with the following.

#### Make sure the app works

Make migrations

```
./manage.py migrate
```

Install Bower Components

```
bower install
```

And, finally, run the server

```
./manage.py runserver
```

Feel free to create an account and hack away!

All displayed information is demo for now until I add some new migrations and fields to the User model. This is just a brief demonstration of the app and how it's supposed to work
